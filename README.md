# CVE-2023-4696
# Account Takeover Due to Improper Handling of JWT Tokens in memos < v0.13.2
## Description
I want to shed light on a significant security vulnerability I recently discovered within the usememos/memos system. This vulnerability has the potential to allow any user to modify another userâ€™s data, including their password, with relative ease. By exploiting this flaw, attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, leading to a host of security and privacy concerns. Letâ€™s dive into the details of this discovery.
At the heart of this vulnerability is the handling of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), a commonly used mechanism for secure data exchange. In the usememos/memos system, the server fails to adequately verify whether the JWT token has been legitimately issued. This omission means that even a modified JWT, created using tools like https://token.dev, can pass through the systemâ€™s defenses.

 ## Impact
The consequences of this vulnerability are far-reaching and can have a significant impact on the security and privacy of the affected system:

Account Takeover: An attacker armed with a forged JWT token can easily change the password of any user. This essentially grants them full control over the affected userâ€™s account.
Privacy Violations: Unauthorized modifications to a userâ€™s email address can result in serious privacy breaches, exposing sensitive information without the userâ€™s consent.
Data Breaches: Changing a userâ€™s email address can lead to unauthorized access to their sensitive information, potentially culminating in a data breach. Such breaches can have severe legal and financial consequences for both users and the organization.
Reputation Damage: In addition to the aforementioned risks, attackers may exploit this vulnerability to defame users or tarnish the organizationâ€™s reputation, potentially causing long-lasting damage.
